## 🌍 Project Overview

Microplastics have emerged as one of the most persistent and challenging contaminants in modern drinking water systems. Due to their small size, chemical stability, and diverse morphology, microplastic particles often evade conventional treatment processes such as filtration, sedimentation, and adsorption. Beyond their physical presence, microplastics can act as carriers for toxic chemicals and microbial contaminants, raising long-term environmental and public health concerns.

This project investigates the feasibility of **high-voltage non-thermal plasma** as an advanced, non-conventional technique for treating microplastic-contaminated water. The central hypothesis is that plasma–water interactions can induce physicochemical changes—such as oxidation, fragmentation, surface modification, or enhanced leaching—that are difficult to achieve through traditional purification methods.

The experimental approach is based on generating **low-pressure non-thermal plasma using high-voltage electrical excitation**, and exposing microplastic-containing water samples to the plasma under controlled conditions. Plasma discharges are produced using sinusoidal and square-wave high-voltage sources in the range of approximately 8–15 kV, allowing comparison of discharge behavior and treatment effectiveness across different excitation modes.

Water samples containing microplastics are prepared through controlled aging of tap water in single-use plastic containers, creating a representative laboratory-scale system for investigation. Plasma treatment is carried out for multiple exposure durations, after which treated and untreated samples are analysed using spectroscopic techniques. **UV–Visible spectroscopy** is employed to monitor changes in absorbance behaviour associated with dissolved organic matter or degradation products, while **ATR–FTIR spectroscopy** is used to detect possible chemical modifications in polymeric structures. Advanced morphological characterisation using **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)** is planned for subsequent phases to complement the spectroscopic findings.

Rather than focusing solely on end results, this project emphasizes **process understanding and parameter sensitivity**—examining how applied voltage, waveform type, treatment duration, electrode spacing, and gas environment influence plasma stability and plasma–water interactions. The work is intentionally exploratory and research-oriented, aimed at identifying trends, limitations, and promising operating windows rather than claiming immediate large-scale applicability.

Overall, this project seeks to contribute experimental insight into the emerging field of **plasma-assisted water purification**, with specific focus on microplastic remediation. The outcomes are expected to inform future optimisation studies, hybrid treatment strategies, and the broader discussion on sustainable, next-generation water treatment technologies.
